The problems were quite straight forward and could have been solved easily were it not for the time complexity constraints. 

The idea of enforcing  time complexity specification is much appreciated. 
Otherwise, I would have not gone on to use Hash Maps / Dictionaries and instead stuck with the easier option of nesting for loops. 

I'd like it if there were more string based / pattern matching problems involved in the assignment. 
If there are more test cases included with the base Program.cs, it would be great. 
Otherwise - it is quite difficult to copy paste the code onto Leetcode and check if my code passes all the test cases.
